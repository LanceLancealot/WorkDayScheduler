# Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to schedule events for each hour of a typical working day (9 AM to 5 PM). This web app dynamically updates the HTML and CSS using jQuery and utilizes the Day.js library to manage date and time functionality. Users can create, save, and persist events for effective time management.
